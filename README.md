# Car Price Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a machine learning project focused on predicting car prices. The project utilizes various machine learning algorithms to forecast car prices based on attributes such as make, model, year, mileage, and condition. The goal is to assist stakeholders in the automotive industry with pricing strategies, inventory management, and customer negotiations.

## Project Structure
- **Data:** Contains the dataset used for training and testing the machine learning models.
- **Notebooks:** Includes Jupyter Notebooks with the code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, and evaluation.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are as follows:
1. **Data Understanding and Preprocessing:** Explore and preprocess the dataset to prepare it for modeling.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Gain insights into the relationships between different variables and identify patterns or trends influencing car prices.
3. **Model Development:** Build machine learning models, including linear regression, decision tree regression, and random forest regression, to predict car prices.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Assess the performance of the developed models using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the models to optimize their performance.
6. **Documentation and Reporting:** Document the analysis and modeling process, summarize key findings, and present actionable insights and recommendations.


## Results
The project aimed to deliver accurate car price predictions based on the developed machine learning models. Evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared were used to measure the performance of the models.
The best model had an R-squared of 99.999999%.
